# CustomerManagerWebApp

This is a simple customer management CRUD application built with Angular 17.3.8, which consumes a .NET Core 8 backend service. The app uses Angular Material for UI components, `angular/forms` for form handling, and the Angular HttpClient module for making HTTP requests to the backend API.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular 17.3.8**: Front-end framework for building the user interface.
- **Angular Material**: Used for designing responsive and visually appealing UI components.
- **Angular Forms**: Utilized for form handling and validation.
- **HttpClient**: Angular's built-in module for making HTTP requests to the .NET Core backend.
